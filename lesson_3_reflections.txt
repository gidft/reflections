Q1: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

A1: You can use github to backup your work rather than keeping it local 
and risk losing it due to hardware failure.

Q2: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A2: Because someone else could be working on the same repository and this
could cause your changes to be overwritten.

Q3: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

A3: A fork is a copy of a repo that is performed on github, a clone is an exact
copy of a commit and all of it's parents.  A branch is a named offshoot of an 
existing commit.

Q4: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
